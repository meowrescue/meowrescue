        <h1>About Meow Rescue</h1>
        <p>Meow Rescue is a dedicated cat rescue organization based in Pasco County, Florida. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats in need.</p>
        <p>We believe that every cat deserves a loving forever home. Our volunteers work tirelessly to ensure that each cat receives proper medical care, socialization, and ultimately, placement in a suitable adoptive home.</p>
        <h2>Our Founders</h2>
        <p>Meow Rescue was founded in 2018 by Patrick and Sarah Gilmore, whose passion for helping cats began when they rescued a litter of abandoned kittens. What started as a small operation out of their home has grown into a network of dedicated volunteers and foster families throughout Pasco County.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is simple: to improve the lives of cats through rescue, rehabilitation, and adoption. We work to reduce the population of homeless cats through TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) programs and community education.</p>
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Our team consists of dedicated volunteers who donate their time, energy, and resources to help cats in need. From foster parents to adoption counselors, every member of our team plays a vital role in our mission.</p>
